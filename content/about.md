### Who am I?

My name is Peter Mikkelsen, and I am a student at the technical gymnasium 
(HTX) in Esbjerg, Denmark.
I am 16 years old and I have had a very strong interest in programming and
Linux since I attended after school classes in beginner programming at 
[ESBU](http://www.esbu.dk) in 2012.

### What have I done over the years?

The first programming language I ever learned was C#. I was very fascinated
by programming and in the beginning I had no idea that so many other 
programming languages for so many different purposes were available. 

When I switched from Windows 8 to Linux 
([Linux Mint](http://http://www.linuxmint.com/) to be precise) in late 2012, I wanted to
try a new language as I didn´t have MS visual studio available to me anymore.
The language I went on to try was C++, so I got myself a book about it and 
started to make some small programs, but it didn´t take many months before I
switched to C because I didn´t like object oriented programming model. C
became my favorite language so far and I went on using it for a long time 
for small programs.

But then I got bored and I wanted to try something new again.
This time I went for something completely different: 
[_Haskell_](https://www.haskell.org/)  
Haskell made me think very different about many problems, and I really
enjoyed learning it, but I have yet to wrap my head around some of the 
more complex topics. In fact, I tried to learn Haskell **3 times** before
I was able to do something with it on my own.

As far as Linux distributions go, I started with mint, and then I have
been jumping around mainly between [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) and 
[Archlinux](https://www.archlinux.org/). Currently I am using Arch because
I like Arch for being very cutting edge and configurable from the installation 
and up.

### What am I interested in?

At the moment, my biggest interest is learning [Haskell](https://haskell.org).
The reason for trying to learn haskell again is that I really like the way
you are programming in it, compared to C or Go for example.

I am also very interested in the release of 
[Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/), and the release of fedora 23.
