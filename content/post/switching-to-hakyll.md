Hakyll instead of Hugo
----------------------

The reason I decided to go from hugo to [hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)
is that its written in haskell.
When I heard about hakyll, I thought it would be a fun project to try out, and
one that I would learn a lot from. So far, I have managed to set it up, and I 
really like it. There are a few things you can expect when the blog gets up and
running
### A new theme 
On this blog I use a theme that was not created by me, and I have no idea of how
it works really, but on the new blog, I will set up my own theme from scratch. 
I have yet to find out what my theme is going to look like, but I hope to have a
functional version of it soon. This means that the navigation links will probably
be on a different location on the page, but I will try to make it user friendly 
and mobile friendly.
### Different URLs
When switching to hakyll, the URLs for my posts will probably change, and that 
means that any blogpost I currently have will get a new URL, and therefore all
links to it on Google+ and reddit will be invalid. I have yet to find a way to 
fix this, but if I don't, I will write a notice about it on the 404 page.

This entire change is the reason I have not posted anything for some time, but 
when the transition is done, I will start writing some haskell related content.
