Why I made this blog
--------------------

There are multiple reasons why I decided on making this blog:

* First of all, I think it will be a fun experience and I will probably learn
a lot under the process.
* I believe that this will help me remember some of the things I learn better,
since I will write about it.
* This blog is meant to inform everyone about what I do, and hopefully, someone
will learn new things, or just get a new perspective on stuff.
* I have a _wonderful_ girlfriend who is not as geeky as me, so I also hope that 
she will be able to learn something and become more interested in the things I do.
* I hope that I maybe will find someone with the same interests as me, and that 
we might build something together someday.

What I am planning to post
--------------------------

My plans for the content on this blog are:

* I will probably be making a post in the end of each month about what has
caught my interest that month, what I have been doing and so on.
* Small posts about some programming problem or trick that I stumble upon.
* Maybe some reviews about Linux distributions or other software.
* My opinion about things (Technology related).

Those are what my initial plans are for content, but you are always welcome
to email me about something you would like me to write about, and I will 
take it up for consideration.

How often I will post
---------------------

My plans are that the main content for this blog will be posted when I find
something interesting to write about. The reason for this and not "one post per
week" for example, is that I want to make good quality content (at least as 
good as I am able to), and that means I will have to be interested about the 
topic.
