Why changing this blog
----------------------

After some time with no activity on the blog, I have decided to make a change.
Instead of blogging about all sorts of things, like Linux related stuff,
multiple different programming languages and other technology news, I will now
only be posting about Haskell programming.
There are multiple things I want to explain about this change:

* First of all, I have been very interested in Haskell again the
last few weeks.
* I think that focusing on one language will make me more experienced in Haskell,
compared to before where I "jumped around" between all different programming
languages from one day to another.
* This blog will have a more specific target group, and therefore I can explain
things in a different way, while they will still be able to understand it.
* The blog itself will hopefully become more interesting and consistent for
the readers.

What I plan to post
-------------------

There are three different things I plan to be blogging about now:

* New things that I have learnt, and that might be useful for other
new Haskell programmers.
* Software I am working on, and how I design it.
* Small toy programs that I try to make, to focus on a specific problem,
and to get some Haskell code written in short time. 

The last one is the one I am most excited about right now, as I hope _you_,
the readers, will come with some challenges for me to do that you think I can
learn from, or just some small things you want to see if I am able to do. 
The challenges can just be posted in the comments :)
